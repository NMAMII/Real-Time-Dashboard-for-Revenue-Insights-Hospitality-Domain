# Real-Time Dashboard for Revenue Insights | Hospitality Domain

## Project Overview
This project involves building a real-time, interactive dashboard to analyze revenue insights in the hospitality domain. The dashboard provides valuable information on booking trends, room occupancy, and revenue performance, aimed at enhancing decision-making for stakeholders.

## Problem Statement
Providing timely and accurate revenue insights can be challenging, especially for complex queries and large datasets. In the hospitality industry, where occupancy rates and revenue metrics shift frequently, an efficient solution is necessary to track and analyze key performance indicators.

## Solution
Using **Power BI** and **Excel**, this project developed an interactive dashboard to address the need for real-time analytics in the hospitality domain. The dashboard integrates multiple datasets to provide an in-depth view of performance metrics and trends, improving data-driven decision-making for business operations.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: Data visualization, DAX measures, and Power Query for data transformation.
- **Excel**: Initial data preparation and exploratory analysis.

## Datasets
- **dim_date.csv**: Contains date-related data for time-series analysis.
- **dim_hotels.csv**: Details about hotels, including location and category.
- **dim_rooms.csv**: Information on room types and configurations.
- **fact_aggregated_bookings.csv**: Aggregated booking data, including revenue and occupancy rates.
- **fact_bookings.csv**: Detailed booking records for analysis.

## Key Features
1. **Revenue Analysis**: Real-time tracking of revenue across different hotels and room types.
2. **Occupancy Rate Tracking**: Visual representation of occupancy trends by date and room type.
3. **Booking Trends**: Insights into seasonal booking trends, helping stakeholders optimize inventory.
4. **Custom Metrics**: DAX measures to calculate KPIs such as Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR).

## Project Structure
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Initial data transformation in Power Query to ensure consistency across datasets.
- **DAX Measures**: Created DAX measures for custom metrics like occupancy rate, ADR, and RevPAR.
- **Visualization**: Designed an intuitive layout to present data in an actionable format, allowing users to filter by time period, location, and room type.

## Impact
This project enhanced data accessibility and insight generation for revenue managers in the hospitality sector, providing stakeholders with timely, personalized insights that improve operational efficiency and strategic decision-making.
